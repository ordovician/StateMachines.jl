# Beginnings of a State Machine Package
This is an unfinnished package for a State Machine in Julia. It has multiple design goals:

1. A simple and easy to understand implementation. Simplicity is more important than features.
2. Register actions upon transitioning from one particular state to another as well upon entering a particular state or exiting a particular state.
